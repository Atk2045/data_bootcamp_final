# data_bootcamp_final

## Purpose
This repository focuses on analyzing football match data to predict match outcomes and total points for Premier League teams in seasons 2020/21 and 2021/22. The primary research began with **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** in the `Ali_Tamer_MT_Data_bootcamp_.ipynb` file, which serves as the foundation for the extended modeling process.

## Files Overview

1. **2020-2021.csv / 2021-2022.csv**  
   - These files contain the raw football match data for two Premier League seasons.

2. **Ali_Tamer_MT_Data_bootcamp_.ipynb**  
   - Primary research notebook focusing on **EDA**. It includes data exploration, visualization, and insights into match features.

3. **Model1_EDA_and_predictions.ipynb**  
   - Extends the initial EDA by focusing on **match-based predictions** (Model 1), comparing models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

4. **Model_2_EDA_and_Predictions.ipynb**  
   - Builds on the initial work to predict **aggregated total points** over two seasons (Model 2). Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are evaluated for their performance.

5. **Data Bootcamp Final Paper.pdf**  
   - A detailed report summarizing the findings, methodologies, and results from both models.

6. **README.md**  
   - This file provides an overview of the repository and its structure.

## Notes
- The **Ali_Tamer_MT_Data_bootcamp_.ipynb** is the backbone for the EDA, with modeling files extending its findings to predictive tasks.
- The modeling focuses on identifying key features and evaluating model performance to generate accurate predictions.
